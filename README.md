# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Express Sample App
This sample application uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to build a simple, scalable customer signup form that is deployed to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). The application stores data in [Amazon DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and publishes notifications to the [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/) when a customer fills out the form.

## Features
### Themes
The code includes several Bootstrap themes from [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/). You can dynamically change the active theme by setting the THEME environment variable in the [Elastic Beanstalk Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk):

Installed themes include:

* [amelia](http://bootswatch.com/amelia)
* [default](http://bootswatch.com/default)
* [flatly](http://bootswatch.com/flatly)
* [slate](http://bootswatch.com/slate)
* [united](http://bootswatch.com/united)

You can get started using the following steps:
  1. [Install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (CLI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html).
  2. Create an IAM Instance Profile named **aws-elasticbeanstalk-sample-role** with the policy in [iam_policy.json](iam_policy.json). For more information on how to create an IAM Instance Profile, see [Create an IAM Instance Profile for Your Amazon EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/how-to-create-iam-instance-profile.html).
  3. Run `eb init -r <region> -p "Node.js"` to initialize the folder for use with the CLI. Replace `<region>` with a region identifier such as `us-west-2` (see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region) for a full list of region identifiers). For interactive mode, run `eb init` then,
    1. Pick a region of your choice.
    2. Select the **[ Create New Application ]** option.
    3. Enter the application name of your choice.
    4. Answer **yes** to *It appears you are using Node.js. Is this correct?*.
    7. Choose whether you want SSH access to the Amazon EC2 instances.  
      *Note: If you choose to enable SSH and do not have an existing SSH key stored on AWS, the EB CLI requires ssh-keygen to be available on the path to generate SSH keys.*  
  4. Run `eb create --instance_profile aws-elasticbeanstalk-sample-role` to begin the creation of your environment.
    1. Enter the environment name of your choice.
    2. Enter the CNAME prefix you want to use for this environment.
  5. Once the environment creation process completes, run `eb open` to open the application in a browser.
  6. Run `eb terminate --all` to clean up.
